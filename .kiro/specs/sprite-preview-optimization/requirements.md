# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The sprite preview generator currently has slow startup times when processing video files. Users need faster initialization and more responsive processing to improve their workflow efficiency. This feature will optimize the startup performance and overall processing speed of the sprite generation system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the sprite preview generator to start processing immediately, so that I don't have to wait for long initialization delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script is executed THEN the system SHALL begin processing within 2 seconds of startup
2. WHEN scanning the videos directory THEN the system SHALL display progress feedback within 1 second
3. WHEN loading configuration THEN the system SHALL cache frequently accessed settings to avoid repeated file reads

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see immediate feedback about what the system is doing, so that I know the process hasn't stalled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script starts THEN the system SHALL immediately display what operation is being performed
2. WHEN scanning for video files THEN the system SHALL show real-time progress of file discovery
3. WHEN checking for existing processed files THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback about skip decisions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to intelligently skip unnecessary work, so that processing starts faster for subsequent runs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processed files already exist THEN the system SHALL quickly identify and skip them without full video probing
2. WHEN multiple videos need processing THEN the system SHALL prioritize new/unprocessed videos first
3. WHEN configuration hasn't changed THEN the system SHALL reuse cached metadata where possible

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want parallel initialization of system components, so that startup time is minimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script starts THEN the system SHALL initialize file scanning and configuration loading concurrently
2. WHEN checking video files THEN the system SHALL perform existence checks in parallel where safe
3. WHEN preparing output directories THEN the system SHALL create them asynchronously if they don't exist

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized dependency loading, so that only necessary components are loaded at startup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script starts THEN the system SHALL defer loading of heavy dependencies until actually needed
2. WHEN importing modules THEN the system SHALL use lazy loading for non-critical components
3. WHEN initializing workers THEN the system SHALL create thread pools only when processing begins
